#Forked from https://github.com/mrzool/cv-boilerplate and built my own template using pandoac
#to read from a yaml contents file and dynamically typeset for my CV.

#FYI A handy hack is to updated the default tool of LateX workshop's VS Code extension
#To call the make command on save so that pandoc is run on save.

## Intro - Sample of the template using the CVContentTemplate.yml
